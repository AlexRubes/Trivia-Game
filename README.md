# Trivia-Game

For this assignment, I created a trivia form with multiple choice questions (8 questions). 

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz (120 seconds).

The game begins when the user clicks on the "Start Game" btton, the questions will appear and the time will begin to count down. 

The game ends when the time runs out or when the user clicks the "End Now!" button. 

The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
